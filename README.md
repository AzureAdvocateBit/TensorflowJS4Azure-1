# TensorflowJS4Azure

A example repository for serving Azure [Tensorflow JS Pose Estimation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) with Azure Web App for Containers

**PoseNet** can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.
